                "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that focuses on the organization and manipulation of data as objects, rather than simply processing logic or functions. Good OOP practices involve designing reusable and extensible code by creating classes, interfaces, and abstract classes.\r\n\r\nWhile some programming languages like Java are purely OOP, others like Typescript combine OOP principles with scripting capabilities. In OOP, a model is designed to represent a real-life entity, and then that model is used to create different but similar objects. For example, a Car can be considered a model that defines the properties and behaviors of a generic car, and a specific car like a Ford Ranger can be an instance of that model that behaves like all other cars but may have its own unique characteristics."
